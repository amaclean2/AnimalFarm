# Agent Survival Simulation - Instructions

## Overview
This is a multi-agent survival simulation where agents navigate a resource-constrained environment with day-night cycles. Agents must balance exploring to find resources, collecting food, and resting to survive as long as possible.

## Core Mechanics
- The world is a grid of cells (50 x 50)
- Each cell may contain resources worth a set number of calories
- Agents have two energy systems: calories and sleep energy
- During the day, agents move around and collect resources
- During night, agents sleep to restore sleep energy and consume collected calories
- Agents die if they run out of either calories or sleep energy

## Agent Behavior
- Agents can sense nearby resources within their detection range
- Movement is partly directed toward resources and partly random
- When an agent hits a wall, its movement direction is adjusted to move away
- Each move costs sleep energy
- Agents need to collect enough food each day to survive the night
- Sleep automatically restores sleep energy during the night phase
- The simulation continues until all agents die

## Controls
- SPACE: Pause/resume the simulation
- R: Restart the simulation
- ESC: Exit the simulation
- TAB: Switch between agents (to follow different agents with the camera)

## Configuration
The simulation can be customized in config.py:
- World size and resource density
- Agent energy levels and consumption rates
- Day length (moves per day)
- Regrowth settings for consumed cells
- Display settings (colors, viewport size, etc.)

## Visualization
- The simulation features a day-night cycle with different color schemes
- The status panel shows agent information and world statistics
- Agent sensing radius is visualized to show what resources they can detect
- Resources are color-coded (green = full, light green = regrowing, brown = consumed)

## Multi-Agent System
- Up to 4 agents can compete for resources
- Each agent has a unique color for identification
- When an agent dies, you can switch to other living agents
- The agent that survives the longest wins

## Game Over
When all agents die, the simulation displays the final statistics and the winner.

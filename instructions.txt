- build a world made of cells on a 20 x 20 array
- display the world in pygame
- each cell has resources worth two calories
- once the cell has been consumed, it will not grow back

- there is one agent class
- this agent has a certain amount of energy from sleep and a certain amount of calories from food
- the agent keeps moving to new cells consuming resources
- it's movement is random, but it takes the agerage of the last movement and the new movement and goes in that direction
- if the agent is against a wall, the last movement get's flipped 180 degrees so the average should be away from the wall
- each move it makes it gets tired and burns calories as well as sleep
- when it's sleep health is down to half, it sleeps until it is full again
- as it's sleeping it burns one calorie per turn
- as it's moving it burns two calories per turn
- if the agent runs out of calories or sleep energy, it dies
- the game keeps looping until the agent dies
